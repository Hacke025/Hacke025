- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hacke025
- 👀 I’m interested in: Game Design!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: how to start making games.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate: on simple and small projects that I can learn from.
- 📫 How to reach me: email or github (though will probably take a while).
- ⚡ Fun fact: Pokemon and gaming fan.

Sup, Div here! Or Hacke_025 Or Pokemon_025... Too many things to state but there is not enough space to express all that which is condensed within.
